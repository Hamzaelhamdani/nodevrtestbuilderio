# Project Title (Replace with your project name)

## Description

(Add a brief description of your project here: What it does, its purpose, etc.)

## Technologies Used

*   .NET (Specify version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7)
*   ASP.NET Core (If applicable, specify version)
*   Entity Framework Core (Specify version)
*   PostgreSQL
*   (Any other frameworks, libraries, or tools used)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Specify version compatible with your project)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running.
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Optional, for cloning the repository)
*   An IDE or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    *   Open `appsettings.json` (or `appsettings.Development.json`).
    *   Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section.
    *   Update the connection string for PostgreSQL. It should look something like this:
        ```json
        "ConnectionStrings": {
          "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=your_database_name;Username=your_username;Password=your_password;"
        }
        ```
    *   Ensure you have created the database `your_database_name` in PostgreSQL.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The .NET CLI will typically restore packages automatically when building or running. If you need to do it manually:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

## Database Migrations (Entity Framework Core)

This project uses Entity Framework Core for database migrations.

1.  **Install EF Core Tools:**
    If you haven't already, install the EF Core command-line tools. You can install it as a global tool or a local tool.

    *   As a global tool (run once):
        ```bash
        dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
        ```
    *   As a local tool (per project, create a tool manifest if you don't have one):
        ```bash
        dotnet new tool-manifest # if you don't have one
        dotnet tool install dotnet-ef
        ```

2.  **Creating a New Migration:**
    Whenever you make changes to your model classes (entities), you'll need to create a new migration.

    Navigate to the directory containing your `DbContext` and project file (`.csproj`) and run:
    ```bash
    # If using global tool
    dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName

    # If using local tool
    dotnet tool run dotnet-ef migrations add YourMigrationName
    ```
    Replace `YourMigrationName` with a descriptive name for your migration (e.g., `AddUserTable`, `UpdateProductSchema`).

3.  **Applying Migrations to the Database:**
    After creating a migration, apply it to your database:
    ```bash
    # If using global tool
    dotnet ef database update

    # If using local tool
    dotnet tool run dotnet-ef database update
    ```
    This will create or update your database schema based on the migrations.

4.  **Reverting a Migration (if needed):**
    To revert the last applied migration:
    ```bash
    # If using global tool
    dotnet ef database update <PreviousMigrationName>

    # If using local tool
    dotnet tool run dotnet-ef database update <PreviousMigrationName>
    ```
    To revert all migrations, you can use `dotnet ef database update 0`.

## Running the Project

1.  **Using the .NET CLI:**
    Navigate to your project's root directory (where the `.csproj` file is) and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    If your solution has multiple runnable projects, you might need to specify the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet run --project path/to/your/project.csproj
    ```

2.  **Using an IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code):**
    *   Open the project/solution in your IDE.
    *   Click the "Run" or "Debug" button.

By default, the application will likely be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001` (or other ports specified in `launchSettings.json`).

## API Endpoints (If applicable)

(Describe the main API endpoints if your project is an API. Include example requests and responses if possible.)

*   **GET /api/resource**: Retrieves a list of resources.
*   **POST /api/resource**: Creates a new resource.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6.  Open a Pull Request.

## License

(Specify the license for your project, e.g., MIT License. If you don't have one, you can choose one from [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)).
